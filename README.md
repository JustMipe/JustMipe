<h1 align="center">Hello world! 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  🧠 I’ve been passionately learning <strong>Rust</strong> since <strong>April 8, 2025</strong><br>
  🏃‍♂️ I occasionally box, go for a run, or work out in other ways.<br>
  🎨 I’ve always wanted to be creative — and even though I can't sing or draw, <br> I’ve found that I can bring my ideas to life through code.

### 🧭 My journey ...

> 📖 I’ve never been the “academic type,” and I’ve been doing manual work since I was 18 — but technology has fascinated me since I was a child. <br>
> 🧱 Today, I’m building my path in Rust slowly, brick by brick — with patience, determination, and passion. <br>
> 💖 I don’t learn Rust because I have ambitions to become a professional developer, but because I truly enjoy it. With plenty of free time, I’m finally fulfilling my childhood dream: to understand programming.
